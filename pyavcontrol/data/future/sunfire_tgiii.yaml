This has con-nector pins at one end connecteddirectly to the pins of the connector atthe other end. For example, pin 1 atone end connects to pin 1 at the otherend, pin 2 connects to pin 2, pin 3 topin 3 and so on.These common cables are avail-able from most computer stores (orfrom Radio Shack as # 26-117). Itshould be 9-pin male at one end, toﬁ t into the TGIII and normally 9-pinfemale at the other, to ﬁ t into yourcomputer's serial port (COM1 orCOM2).User's ManualUpdate Procedure1.
